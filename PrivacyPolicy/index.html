            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="date"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-05-26</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>M Legends</strong> mobile application (hereafter referred to as the "Application"), developed by <strong>Elvin Mammadov</strong> (hereafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is provided "AS IS" and is intended for use as such.</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>The Application collects only non-personal and anonymized game-related data to facilitate gameplay and analytics. This may include, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game session data (e.g., start and end time)</li>
                <li>Game outcome (e.g., who won, how many rounds)</li>
                <li>Anonymous identifiers (e.g., device ID or session ID for tracking game sessions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected ‚Äî such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact list. The data collected is stored securely in Firebase, a cloud database provided by Google, and is used strictly for improving game features, monitoring app performance, and understanding user interaction.</p>

            <h2>Location Information</h2>
            <p>The Application does not collect or use precise location data of your mobile device.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
            <p>The Application may share aggregated and anonymized data with third-party services (such as Firebase Analytics) to enhance gameplay and analyze overall usage. These third parties do not have access to any personally identifiable information and are obligated to comply with this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>Information may also be disclosed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If required by law or legal process</li>
                <li>To protect user safety or the security of the Application</li>
                <li>To trusted service providers working on our behalf (e.g., Firebase), who comply with strict data protection practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
            <p>You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall procedures available through your mobile device settings or app store.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider retains only anonymous game-related data as long as necessary for the purposes described above. Since no personal data is collected, no action is required to delete user-identifiable information. If you have specific questions regarding data retention, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:elvin.m@hotmail.com">elvin.m@hotmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Application does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. Because no personal information is collected, children may use the app without the risk of sharing personal data. However, the Service Provider recommends that parents and guardians supervise children's use of mobile applications.</p>
            <p>If you believe a child has submitted personal information, please contact <a href="mailto:elvin.m@hotmail.com">elvin.m@hotmail.com</a>, and appropriate action will be taken.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider values your trust in providing your game session data and uses industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect this data, especially during transmission and storage in Firebase.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Application after changes are posted will be deemed as your acknowledgment and acceptance of the changes.</p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the processing of your anonymized data as described herein.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Application, please contact the Service Provider at:</p>
